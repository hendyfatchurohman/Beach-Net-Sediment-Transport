# Beach-Net-Sediment-Transport
This script calculates net sediment transport of a littoral cell. All you need is a time series digital elevation model. The result will show you the Dem of Difference (DoD) and also calculate the volume change based on the comparison of two DEMs. 

  The coastal sediment budget quantifies sediment inputs and outputs within a defined coastal system, determining whether a coastline is accreting, eroding, or in an equilibrium state (Bird, 2008). It represents the total volume of sediment supplied to and lost from a coastal compartment over a specified time frame. Understanding sediment budgets is essential for predicting coastal evolution, assessing the impacts of sea-level rise, and managing coastal erosion risks (Aagaard, 2011; Carvalho and Woodroffe, 2021). Sediment budgets can be customised to reflect different temporal scales, ranging from short-term phenomena such as seasonal variations to extended historical durations or present conditions at a location. Therefore, determining the sediment budget over longer timescales is also essential for distinguishing geological trends from short-term variability (Goodwin et al., 2020). 

  Sources of sediment are commonly known as “inputs” to the littoral system and can be obtained through different mechanisms. Sources of sediment are essential for the sustainability of sediment circulation and may originate from various sources such as eroding cliffs, onshore transport, contributions from dune stores, fluvial input, beach nourishment (artificial input), and longshore transport into the system. Sediment sinks and storage can be regarded as “outputs” to the littoral system, which include: offshore banks, pits, bars, shoals; storage in dunes; particle attrition; offshore transport of fines; dredging; and longshore transport that leave the sub-cell through the littoral sub-cell boundary (Cooper and Pethick, 2005).  The net balance between inputs and outputs determine whether coastlines experience accretion, erosion, or stability.

In quantifying sediment budgets, defining the spatial boundary within a coastal system is fundamental. Sediment compartments, or littoral cells defined as semi-enclosed systems where sediment sources, transport pathways, and sinks are contained within natural boundaries (Goodwin et al., 2020).
